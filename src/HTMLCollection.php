 * HTMLCollection.php
 * ------------------
 * FROM THE SPEC:
 *
 *      "HTMLCollection is a historical artifact we cannot rid the web of. 
 *      While developers are of course welcome to keep using it, new API 
 *      standard designers ought not to use it (use sequence<T> in IDL 
 *      instead)."
 *
 * USAGE 
 *
 * Returned by:
 *      Document::getElementsByTagName()
 *      Document::getElementsByTagNameNS()
 *      Document::getElementsByClassNames()
 *      Element::getElementsByTagName()
 *      Element::getElementsByTagNameNS()
 *      Element::getElementsByClassNames()
 *
 * Type of:
 *      Element::children
 *      
 * An HTMLCollection is always "in the DOM," that is, it is
 * always associated with some kind of Document root.
 *
 * A NodeList, on the other hand, may or may not be in the DOM.
 *
 * If a collection contains objects in the DOM, it is assumed
 * to be "live", that is, if the underlying Document changes,
 * then the collection must also update.
 *
 * Live-ness is not really a problem, EXCEPT for 
 * the namedItems() method. That needs to look up
 * an element by its 'id', or as a fallback, for
 * certain kinds of elements, its 'name' attribute. 
 * 
 * What a real pain in the ass.
 *
 * PORT NOTE
 * In domino.js, this was done with all this modtime,
 * lastModTime, update, blah blah blah, but didn't even
 * capture the key thing of the 'id' or 'name' changing
 * on the underlying nodes. Those changes did not change
 * the Node's lastModTime, and hence would not trigger the 
 * cache here to update, breaking live-ness. Great.

/* DOM-LS:
 * 4.2.10. Old-style collections: NodeList and HTMLCollection
 * A collection is an object that represents a list of nodes. 
 * A collection can be either live or static. Unless otherwise stated, 
 * a collection must be live.
 *
 * If a collection is live, then the attributes and methods on that object 
 * must operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the data.
 *
 * When a collection is created, a filter and a root are associated with it.
 *
 * The collection then represents a view of the subtree rooted at the 
 * collectionâ€™s root, containing only nodes that match the given filter. 
 * The view is linear. In the absence of specific requirements to the contrary, 
 * the nodes within the collection must be sorted in tree order.

/*
 * Element::children will be an instance of this class.
 * It defines length, item() and namedItem().

 * Compare the similar NamedNodeMap, used to implement
 * Element::attributes.

 * TODO: Clean up to bring in line with style guidelines used elsewhere.

/* THE SINGLE REASON THAT Node::__mod_time EXISTS IS THIS THING */
